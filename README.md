FizzBuzz-Advanced Function

By Steve Buckley

This function has one method.  It takes two arguments, a number to test, and a hash of divisor keys and corresponding text values.

It returns the following:
  a) a string of concatenated text values for each key that
      evenly divides into the test value, or
  d) if no keys divide evenly, the test value itself.

  The code uses modulus to determine the results.
